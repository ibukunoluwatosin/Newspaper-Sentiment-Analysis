# Using NLP to Detect Bias in Political News in The Last Two Administrations.

I scraped news headlines and their publishing dates from _http://www.nigeria70.com/nigerian_news_paper/archives_ for four major news outlets:

1. Sahara
2. Vanguard
3. Punch
4. Guardian

The data is approximately 50,000 headlines each.

 Employing NLP methods such as ngram analysis, sentiment analysis and leveraging relevant packages such as the tidytext and sentimentr packages, I analyzed for bias and change in sentiment & rhetoric in Nigerian media reporting for politics between the last two tenures.
